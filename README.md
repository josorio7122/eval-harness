# Eval Harness

A lightweight evaluation harness for running LLM graders against test datasets. Build datasets of test cases, define grading rubrics, run experiments, and review results in a dense, scannable interface.

## What it does

- Create datasets with custom attributes (input, expected_output, plus any custom fields)
- Define graders with natural-language rubrics for LLM-based evaluation
- Run experiments that evaluate every test case against selected graders, using a model you choose per experiment
- Select from 14 pre-configured models grouped by provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Mistral, DeepSeek)
- Review results in a dense table — rows are items, columns are graders, cells show pass/fail verdicts
- Dataset versioning via immutable revisions — experiments pin to a snapshot, so results are reproducible
- Author versioned prompts — pair system and user messages with model configuration, with full version history

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+, pnpm 9+, Docker

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d

# 3. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OPENROUTER_API_KEY

# 4. Push database schema
pnpm --filter db exec prisma db push

# 5. Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

API runs on http://localhost:3001, frontend on http://localhost:5173

## Scripts

| Command          | Description                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`       | Start API + web in dev mode |
| `pnpm build`     | Build all packages          |
| `pnpm test`      | Run unit tests              |
| `pnpm lint`      | Lint all packages           |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check all packages     |
| `pnpm format`    | Format with Prettier        |

## Try It Out

The `test-data/` directory includes everything you need to see the harness in action: a sample dataset, four pre-written graders, and a seed script that sets it all up in one command.

### Quick start (automated)

With the dev server running:

```bash
./test-data/seed.sh
```

This creates a "Customer Support QA" dataset with 30 test cases, four graders (Helpfulness, Tone & Empathy, Accuracy, Completeness), and three pre-seeded experiments with pre-computed results:

- **Baseline GPT-4o Run** (~90% pass)
- **Gemini Flash Run** (~63% pass)
- **Claude Haiku Run** (~43% pass)

Open the UI at http://localhost:5173 to explore the seeded experiments immediately — no API key needed to browse results. An `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is only required to run new experiments.

### What's included

**[customer-support-dataset.csv](test-data/customer-support-dataset.csv)** — 30 customer support interactions across billing, account, technical, product, and policy categories. Each row has an `input` (customer message), `expected_output` (ideal response), `category`, and `difficulty` (easy/medium/hard). You can also import this CSV manually from the Datasets page in the UI.

> **Note:** The seed script requires Docker. The `eval-harness-db` container must be running because the script uses `docker exec` to insert experiment results directly via psql.

**[recommended-evals.md](test-data/recommended-evals.md)** — Four grader rubrics designed for this dataset. Each grader evaluates a different dimension of response quality:

| Grader         | What it evaluates                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helpfulness    | Does the response actually answer the question with actionable next steps?             |
| Tone & Empathy | Is the tone professional and calibrated to the customer's emotional state?             |
| Accuracy       | Are all facts consistent with the expected output — no contradictions or fabrications? |
| Completeness   | Does the response address every part of the question without omitting key details?     |

You can use these rubrics as-is or adapt them for your own datasets. The seed script creates all four automatically, or you can copy them from the markdown file and create graders manually in the UI.

## What I'd Improve

- **Job queue** — Replace in-process p-queue with BullMQ + Redis. Current setup loses jobs on restart and doesn't scale horizontally.
- **Revision storage** — Switch from full-copy revisions to a log-based approach (append-only deltas). Current model duplicates all items per revision.
- **Results storage** — Move experiment results to a columnar store (ClickHouse) for faster analytical queries at scale.
- **Prompt playground** — Add an interactive playground so users can execute prompts against models directly, iterate on outputs, and evaluate results in one workflow. (Prompt versioning and management is now implemented.)
- **Re-run with a different model** — Allow re-running an existing experiment with a different LLM model to compare outputs across models without recreating the experiment.
